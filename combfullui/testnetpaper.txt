HAIRCOMB TESNTET WHITEPAPER v1

Abstract: A public haircomb testnet would make experimentation with the coin easier and cheaper.

1. Address format

   We will be using lowercase addresses / deciders on the testnet. Internal identifiers, such as
   liquidity stacks and identifiers in wallet format remain upper case. The hex loading algo was
   fixed to be able to load lowercase.

2. Hashing format (Domain separation)

   Instead of normal SHA256(x), testnet uses SHA256(w + w + x), where w is this whitepaper hash. It's there
   twice to align with sha256's internal block size. This is true for almost all hashing operations.

   This means, that, commitments, for instance use:
   SHA256(testnet_whitepaper + testnet_whitepaper + mainnet_whitepaper + commited_value)

   Only place, where usual SHA256 is still used, is internal hashing - in the leveldb format
   (the in-block checksum).

3. Database

   The database is stored in the commits_testnet folder.

4. Wallet format

   To prevent somebody from accidentally loading their main net wallet, the slashes in the wallet format use the
   (\) character, instead of the usual (/) character. This, combined with domain separation ensures
   that, with high probability, spending a main net key on testnet would not be a problem.

5. Starting the testnet

   A config.txt file needs to be created, with the btcmode=testnet line in it. Bitcoin needs to run with the -testnet
   flag.

6. User interface

   The main page contains the word Testnet, as well as a green background for almost all pages.
